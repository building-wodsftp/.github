<h1>wodSFTP Overview</h1><p><strong>wodSFTP</strong> is a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client component developed by WeOnlyDo! Software. Designed primarily for developers, wodSFTP enables applications to perform secure file transfers over SSH2 networks by integrating an ActiveX control or COM object into Windows software projects. It simplifies the implementation of encrypted file operations such as upload, download, directory management, and remote file system access in custom applications written in languages such as Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, ASP, and other Windows development environments.</p><h2>Purpose of the Program</h2><p>The core purpose of <strong>wodSFTP</strong> is to provide a reusable software component that adds secure file transfer capabilities to Windows applications. It allows developers to embed SFTP functionality directly into their software without building networking and encryption layers from scratch. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) runs over SSH2, ensuring that data, credentials, and directory contents are protected with strong encryption during transit.</p><h2>Main Features</h2><ul><li>Support for secure file transfers using SSH2 with AES, DES, and BLOWFISH encryption.</li><li>Upload and download files using PutFile and GetFile methods.</li><li>Directory operations including MakeDir, RemoveDir, ListItems, and DeleteFile.</li><li>64-bit file size support for large file transfers.</li><li>Proxy support for major server environments.</li><li>Asynchronous and blocking modes for flexible integration.</li><li>Authentication via password or public/private key pairs.</li></ul><h2>Unique Aspects</h2><p><strong>wodSFTP</strong> stands out as both an ActiveX control and a COM object, making it adaptable for different types of Windows development projects. It includes both x86 and x64 binaries and supports callback events, enabling efficient and responsive integration for secure file operations.</p><h2>Target Audience</h2><p>This component is aimed at software developers and engineers who need to embed secure file transfer functionality into custom Windows applications or services. It is suitable for use in enterprise software, web applications, administrative scripts, and automation tools that require robust SFTP support.</p><h2>Benefits of Use</h2><p>Using <strong>wodSFTP</strong> allows developers to avoid the complexities of implementing SFTP protocols and encryption libraries manually. This leads to faster development cycles, reduced errors, and secure data transfers compliant with modern security standards.</p><h2>Functional Modules</h2><p>The component package includes the wodSFTP ActiveX control (OCX), the wodSFTP COM object (DLL), optional key management components, and sample code for various development environments. Together, these modules facilitate seamless integration of SFTP protocols into Windows applications.</p><h2>Technical Requirements</h2><p>wodSFTP runs on Windows operating systems and requires compatible development tools such as Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, ASP, or VBS. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit environments and integrates with applications that can host ActiveX or COM components.</p><h2>Supported Platforms</h2><p>The component is intended for Windows development and deployment, supporting legacy and modern Windows releases where ActiveX and COM integrations are possible.</p><h2>Algorithms and Technologies Used</h2><p><strong>wodSFTP</strong> uses OpenSSL for cryptographic operations. The integration with the SSH2 protocol enables secure encrypted sessions for data transfer, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.</p><h2>Security and Data Protection</h2><p>SFTP inherently secures data by encrypting all transferred information. wodSFTP leverages industry-standard encryption algorithms through OpenSSL, mitigating the risk of data interception on untrusted networks.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>The performance of <strong>wodSFTP</strong> depends on the underlying network, server capabilities, and encryption overhead. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations to optimize responsiveness in diverse application scenarios.</p><h2>Updates and Releases</h2><p>Recent versions of wodSFTP have introduced support for newer cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL3 and included 64-bit support along with other enhancements.</p><h2>Licensing and Terms of Use</h2><p>wodSFTP is typically distributed as shareware or licensed component. Licensing grants redistribution rights for binaries within applications, subject to vendor terms.</p><h2>Limitations</h2><p>As a developer-oriented component, wodSFTP does not provide a standalone user interface for end users. Instead, it requires integration into custom applications. Trial versions may include usage limits or nags.</p><h2>Typical Usage Scenarios</h2><p>Developers use wodSFTP to add secure upload/download features, script automated backups to remote servers, manage remote file systems, and build enterprise-level secure file transfer solutions.</p><h2>Installation and Setup</h2><p>Installation involves registering the ActiveX control or COM object on Windows with tools such as RegSvr32, or including the binary components in a software installer for distribution. Sample code helps developers get started quickly.</p><h2>Running Instructions</h2><p>After installation, developers call SFTP methods from their code to establish connections, authenticate, and perform file operations using the provided API. Documentation and example projects assist with integration.</p>
